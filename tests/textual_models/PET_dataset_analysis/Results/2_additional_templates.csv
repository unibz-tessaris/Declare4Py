"Whenever a company makes the decision to go public, its first task is to select the underwriters. Underwriters act as financial midwives to a new issue. Usually they play a triple role : First they provide the company with procedural and financial advice, then they buy the issue, and finally they resell it to the public. Established underwriters are careful of their reputation and will not handle a new issue unless they believe the facts have been presented fairly. Thus, in addition to handling the sale of a company ’ s issue, the underwriters in effect give their seal of approval to it. They prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition to registering the issue with the SEC, they need to check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state. While the registration statement is awaiting approval, underwriters begin to firm up the issue price. They arrange a road show to talk to potential investors. Immediately after they receive clearance from the SEC, underwriters fix the issue price. After that they enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock and then offer it to the public, when they haven ’ t still found any reason not to do it.","['precedence(receive clearance from SEC, fix issue price)', 'Init(select underwriters)', 'succession(select underwriters, prepare registration statement)', 'succession(fix issue price, enter firm commitment)', 'chain-succession(prepare registration statement, register with SEC)', 'chain-response(arrange road show, firm up issue price)']",0,6,"['registerwithSEC', 'firmupissueprice', 'receiveclearancefromSEC', 'selectunderwriters', 'arrangeroadshow', 'prepareregistrationstatement', 'enterfirmcommitment', 'fixissueprice']",8

"At the beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded. A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO. At the customer service an employee enters (based on the received data) a problem report into system T.. Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are. Based on this, the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities. An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship. In case the customer is premium, the process will link to an extra problem fix process (this process will not be detailed here). In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon, the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues. Taking together the information (i.e. contract commitment data + prioritized actions) a detailed problem report is created. The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management. Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers. After receiving the detailed problem report, Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning. In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves, the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning. If Service Management is sure they can analyze it, they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem. After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report, it is checked whether there are any possible problems. If no problems are detected, a notification about the normal service execution is created. If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created. Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management. Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information. Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report. Three alternative process paths may be taken. For the case that no problem was detected at all, the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service. For the case that minor corrective actions are required, Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves. Subsequently, the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service. After sending, this process path of Service Management ends. For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required, Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration. This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning. Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out, otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process. After the restoration request is received, all possible errors are tracked. Based on the tracked errors, all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning. Then a trouble-shooting report is created. This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends. The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii). Customer Service either receives the actual service performance (if there was no problem) or the problem resolution report. Then, two concurrent activities are triggered, i.e. i) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem, and ii) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing. The report for the customer is sent out to her. After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service. After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service, the process flow at the customer also ends.","['existence(Customer_Service_Report_Creation)', 'existence(Problem_Report_Entered)', 'existence(SLA_Comparison)', 'existence(Counter_Measures_Determined)', 'existence(Customer_Significance_Determined)', 'existence(Detailed_Problem_Report_Created)', 'existence(Sent_to_Service_Management)', 'existence(Service_Management_Analysis)', 'existence(Resource_Provisioning_Analysis)', 'existence(Status_Report_Sent)', 'existence(Problem_Resolution_Report_Created)', 'existence(Customer_Report_Created)', 'existence(SLA_Violation_Rebate_Reported)', 'response(Service_Management_Analysis, Resource_Provisioning_Analysis)', 'response(Service_Management_Analysis, Corrective_Actions_Taken)', 'succession(Customer_Service_Report_Creation, Problem_Report_Entered)', 'succession(Problem_Report_Entered, SLA_Comparison)', 'succession(SLA_Comparison, Counter_Measures_Determined)', 'succession(Counter_Measures_Determined, Customer_Significance_Determined)', 'succession(Customer_Significance_Determined, Detailed_Problem_Report_Created)', 'succession(Detailed_Problem_Report_Created, Sent_to_Service_Management)', 'succession(Sent_to_Service_Management, Service_Management_Analysis)', 'succession(Service_Management_Analysis, Resource_Provisioning_Analysis)', 'succession(Resource_Provisioning_Analysis, Trouble_Report_Created)', 'succession(Resource_Provisioning_Analysis, Normal_Execution_Notification_Created)', 'succession(Status_Report_Sent, Corrective_Actions_Taken)', 'succession(Status_Report_Sent, Restoration_Request_Sent)', 'succession(Restoration_Request_Sent, Errors_Tracked)', 'succession(Errors_Tracked, Trouble_Shooting_Report_Created)', 'succession(Trouble_Shooting_Report_Created, Problem_Resolution_Report_Created)', 'succession(Problem_Resolution_Report_Created, Customer_Report_Created)', 'succession(Problem_Resolution_Report_Created, SLA_Violation_Rebate_Reported)', 'succession(Customer_Report_Created, SLA_Violation_Rebate_Reported)', 'not-exclusive-choice(Trouble_Report_Created, Normal_Execution_Notification_Created)']",0,34,"['Normal_Execution_Notification_Created', 'SLA_Comparison', 'Resource_Provisioning_Analysis', 'Service_Management_Analysis', 'Corrective_Actions_Taken', 'Trouble_Report_Created', 'Customer_Significance_Determined', 'Detailed_Problem_Report_Created', 'Restoration_Request_Sent', 'Problem_Report_Entered', 'Trouble_Shooting_Report_Created', 'Counter_Measures_Determined', 'Status_Report_Sent', 'Problem_Resolution_Report_Created', 'Customer_Service_Report_Creation', 'Sent_to_Service_Management', 'Customer_Report_Created', 'SLA_Violation_Rebate_Reported', 'Errors_Tracked']",19

"The Evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel. When a guest calls room service at The Evanstonian, the room-service manager takes down the order. She then submits an order ticket to the kitchen to begin preparing the food. She also gives an order to the sommelier (i.e., the wine waiter) to fetch wine from the cellar and to prepare any other alcoholic beverages. Eighty percent of room-service orders include wine or some other alcoholic beverage. Finally, she assigns the order to the waiter. While the kitchen and the sommelier are doing their tasks, the waiter readies a cart (i.e., puts a tablecloth on the cart and gathers silverware). The waiter is also responsible for nonalcoholic drinks. Once the food, wine, and cart are ready, the waiter delivers it to the guest ’ s room. After returning to the room-service station, the waiter debits the guest ’ s account.

"The process is initiated by a switch-over request. In doing so, the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company. Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution. The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system. After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility. In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list. The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times. In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base, a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow. This object consists of data elements such as the customers name and address and the assigned power gauge. The generated customer object is then used, in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch (including data such as bank connection, information on the selected rate, requested date of switch-over). In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS (customer information system) in order to confirm their successful generation. In case of a negative response, i.e. the contract documents are not (or incorrectly) generated, the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved. Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again. In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed. A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS. It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future. The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence, and the grid operator transmits a response comment. In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict. The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier (i.e. the customer service (of the new supplier) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination). If there are not any objections by the grid operator (i.e. no supplier concurrence), customer service creates a CIS contract. The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it. Depending on the customers acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends (in case of withdrawal) or continues (in case of a confirmation). An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues. The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary (as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way) but it can speed up the switch process. On the switch-date, but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun, the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report. At the same time, the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier. Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer. For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then. After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information. The process of winning a new customer ends here.","['response(transmit customer data, enter customer data object)', 'response(compare customer data, check completeness and plausibility)', 'response(check completeness and plausibility, correct errors)', 'response(prepare contract documents, automated check contract documents)', 'response(generate contract documents, send confirmation document)', 'response(send request to grid operator, check supplier concurrence)', 'response(send final billing, import meter data)', 'not-succession(correct errors, create new customer object)', 'not-succession(check supplier concurrence, resolve conflict)', 'not-response(automated check contract documents, analyze and resolve issues)', 'not-precedence(transmit power meter data, compute final billing)', 'not-chain-response(check contract details, withdraw from contract)', 'succession(enter customer data object, compare customer data)', 'succession(create new customer object, prepare contract documents)', 'succession(analyze and resolve issues, generate contract documents)', 'succession(send confirmation document, send request to grid operator)', 'succession(resolve conflict, terminate sales agreement)', 'succession(confirm contract, create CIS contract)', 'succession(compute final billing, send final billing)', 'exclusive-choice(withdraw from contract, confirm contract)']",0,20,"['preparecontractdocuments', 'createnewcustomerobject', 'checkcompletenessandplausibility', 'sendfinalbilling', 'checksupplierconcurrence', 'automatedcheckcontractdocuments', 'checkcontractdetails', 'entercustomerdataobject', 'computefinalbilling', 'terminatesalesagreement', 'transmitpowermeterdata', 'resolveconflict', 'comparecustomerdata', 'sendrequesttogridoperator', 'correcterrors', 'createCIScontract', 'generatecontractdocuments', 'sendconfirmationdocument', 'transmitcustomerdata', 'analyzeandresolveissues', 'confirmcontract', 'withdrawfromcontract', 'importmeterdata']",23

"The intake workflow starts with a notice by telephone at the secretarial office of the mental health care institute. This notice is done by the family doctor of somebody who is in need of mental treatment. The secretarial worker inquires after the name and residence of the patient. On the basis of this information, the doctor is put through to the nursing officer responsible for the part of the region that the patient lives in. The nursing officer makes a full inquiry into the mental, health, and social state of the patient in question. This information is recorded on a registration form. At the end of the conversation, this form is handed in at the secretarial office of the institute. Here, the information on the form is stored in the information system and subsequently printed. For new patients, a patient file is created. The registration form as well as the print from the information system are stored in the patient file. Patient files are kept at the secretarial office and may not leave the building. At the secretarial office, two registration cards are produced for respectively the future first and second intaker of the patient. The registration card contains a set of basic patient data. The new patient is added on the list of new notices. Halfway the week, at Wednesday, a staff meeting of the entire medical team takes place. The medical team consists of social-medical workers, physicians, and a psychiatrist. At this meeting, the team-leader assigns all new patients on the list of new notices to members of the team. Each patient will be assigned to a social-medical worker, who will act as the first intaker of the patient. One of the physicians will act as the second intaker. In assigning intakers, the teamleader takes into account their expertise, the region they are responsible for, earlier contacts they might have had with the patient, and their case load. The assignments are recorded on an assignment list which is handed to the secretarial office. For each new assignment, it is also determined whether the medical file of the patient is required. This information is added to the assignment list. The secretarial office stores the assignment of each patient of the assignment list in the information system. It passes the produced registration cards to the first and second intaker of each newly assigned patient. An intaker keeps this registration with him at times when visiting the patient and in his close proximity when he is at the office. For each patient for which the medical file is required, the secretarial office prepares and sends a letter to the family doctor of the patient, requesting for a copy of the medical file. As soon as this copy is received, the secretarial office will inform the second intaker and add the copy to the patient file. The first intaker plans a meeting with the patient as soon as this is possible. During the first meeting, the patient is examined using a standard checklist which is filled out. Additional observations are registered in a personal notebook. After a visit, the first intaker puts a copy of these notes in the file of a patient. The standard checklist is also added to the patients file. The second intaker plans the first meeting only after the medical information of the physician if required has been received. Physicians use dictaphones to record their observations made during meetings with patients. The secretarial office types out these tapes, after which the information is added to the patient file. As soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place, the secretarial office puts the patient on the list of patients that reach this status. For the staff meeting on Wednesday, they provide the team-leader with a list of these patients. For each of these patients, the first and second intaker together with the team-leader and the attending psychiatrist formulate a treatment plan. This treatment plan formally ends the intake procedure.","['response(notice_by_telephone, inquiry_patient_info)', 'response(inquiry_patient_info, connect_to_nursing_officer)', 'response(nursing_officer_inquiry, record_registration_form)', 'response(record_registration_form, hand_in_registration_form)', 'response(hand_in_registration_form, store_info_in_system)', 'response(store_info_in_system, print_info)', 'response(print_info, create_patient_file)', 'response(create_patient_file, produce_registration_cards)', 'response(produce_registration_cards, add_patient_to_new_notices_list)', 'response(staff_meeting, assign_patients_to_team_members)', 'response(assign_patients_to_team_members, record_assignments)', 'response(record_assignments, store_assignments_in_system)', 'response(store_assignments_in_system, pass_registration_cards_to_intakers)', 'response(first_meeting_with_patient, fill_out_standard_checklist)', 'response(fill_out_standard_checklist, register_additional_observations)', 'response(register_additional_observations, add_notes_and_checklist_to_patient_file)', 'response(second_meeting_with_patient, record_physician_observations)', 'response(record_physician_observations, type_out_physician_observations)', 'response(type_out_physician_observations, add_physician_observations_to_patient_file)', 'response(provide_list_of_patients_to_team_leader, formulate_treatment_plan)', 'co-existence(record_registration_form, store_registration_form_and_print)', 'Init(notice_by_telephone)', 'succession(add_patient_to_new_notices_list, staff_meeting)', 'succession(plan_first_meeting, first_meeting_with_patient)', 'succession(plan_second_meeting, second_meeting_with_patient)', 'succession(patient_on_list_of_patients_reach_status, provide_list_of_patients_to_team_leader)', 'not-exclusive-choice(plan_first_meeting, plan_second_meeting)']",0,27,"['assign_patients_to_team_members', 'notice_by_telephone', 'store_registration_form_and_print', 'type_out_physician_observations', 'add_physician_observations_to_patient_file', 'store_assignments_in_system', 'plan_first_meeting', 'second_meeting_with_patient', 'add_patient_to_new_notices_list', 'inquiry_patient_info', 'record_physician_observations', 'provide_list_of_patients_to_team_leader', 'hand_in_registration_form', 'add_notes_and_checklist_to_patient_file', 'patient_on_list_of_patients_reach_status', 'pass_registration_cards_to_intakers', 'fill_out_standard_checklist', 'nursing_officer_inquiry', 'create_patient_file', 'record_registration_form', 'register_additional_observations', 'plan_second_meeting', 'connect_to_nursing_officer', 'first_meeting_with_patient', 'store_info_in_system', 'formulate_treatment_plan', 'staff_meeting', 'produce_registration_cards', 'record_assignments', 'print_info']",30

"As a basic principle, ACME AG receives invoices on paper or fax. These are received by the Secretariat in the central inbox and forwarded after a short visual inspection to an accounting employee. In `` ACME Financial Accounting ``, a software specially developed for the ACME AG, she identifies the charging suppliers and creates a new instance (invoice). She then checks the invoice items and notes the corresponding cost center at the ACME AG and the related cost center managers for each position on a separate form (`` docket ``). The docket and the copy of the invoice go to the internal mail together and are sent to the first cost center manager to the list. He reviews the content for accuracy after receiving the copy of the invoice. Should everything be in order, he notes his code one on the docket (`` accurate position - AP ``) and returns the copy of the invoice to the internal mail. From it, the copy of the invoice is passed on to the next cost center manager, based on the docket, or if all items are marked correct, sent back to accounting. Therefore, the copy of invoice and the docket gradually move through the hands of all cost center managers until all positions are marked as completely accurate. However, if inconsistencies exist, e.g. because the ordered product is not of the expected quantity or quality, the cost center manager rejects the AP with a note and explanatory statement on the docket, and the copy of the invoice is sent back to accounting directly. Based on the statements of the cost center managers, she will proceede with the clarification with the vendor, but, if necessary, she consults the cost center managers by telephone or e-mail again. When all inconsistencies are resolved, the copy of the invoice is sent to the cost center managers again, and the process continues. After all invoice items are AP, the accounting employee forwards the copy of the invoice to the commercial manager. He makes the commercial audit and issues the approval for payment. If the bill amount exceeds EUR 20, the Board wants to check it again (4 - eyes-principle). The copy of the invoice including the docket moves back to the accounting employee in the appropriate signature file.

Afterwards, the Assistant Registry Manager within the Registry performs a quality check. If the mail is not compliant, a list of requisition explaining the reason for rejection is compiled and sent back to the party. Otherwise, the matter details (types of action) are captured and provided to the Cashier, who takes the applicable fees attached to the mail. At this point, the Assistant Registry Manager puts the receipt and copied documents into an envelope and posts it to the party. Meantime, the Cashier captures the Party Details and prints the Physical Court File.","['response(Quality check, Compile rejection list)', 'response(Quality check, Capture matter details)', 'not-co-existence(Compile rejection list, Capture matter details)', 'succession(Collect mail, Sort mail)', 'succession(Sort mail, Distribute mail)', 'succession(Distribute mail, Open and sort mail)', 'succession(Open and sort mail, Register mail)', 'succession(Register mail, Quality check)', 'succession(Capture matter details, Take fees)', 'succession(Take fees, Post documents)', 'succession(Capture party details, Print physical court file)', 'succession(Quality check, Post documents)']",0,12,"['Compilerejectionlist', 'Capturematterdetails', 'Collectmail', 'Openandsortmail', 'Sortmail', 'Registermail', 'Postdocuments', 'Distributemail', 'Qualitycheck', 'Takefees', 'Capturepartydetails', 'Printphysicalcourtfile']",12
"The loan approval process starts by receiving a customer request for a loan amount. The risk assessment Web service is invoked to assess the request. If the loan is small and the customer is low risk, the loan is approved. If the customer is high risk, the loan is denied.

"An employee purchases a product or service he requires. For instance, a sales person on a trip rents a car. The employee submits an expense report with a list of items, along with the receipts for each item. A supervisor reviews the expense report and approves or rejects the report. Since the company has expense rules, there are circumstances where the supervisor can accept or reject the report upon first inspection. These rules could be automated, to reduce the workload on the supervisor. If the supervisor rejects the report, the employee, who submitted it, is given a chance to edit it, for example to correct errors or better describe an expense. If the supervisor approves the report, it goes to the treasurer. The treasurer checks that all the receipts have been submitted and match the items on the list. If all is in order, the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing (including, e.g., payment or refund, and accounting). If receipts are missing or do not match the report, he sends it back to the employee. If a report returns to the employee for corrections, it must again go to a supervisor, even if the supervisor previously approved the report. If the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing, the report moves to an automatic activity that links to a payment system. The process waits for the payment confirmation. After the payment is confirmed, the process ends.","['response(reject_expense_report, edit_expense_report)', 'response(approve_expense_report, check_receipts)', 'response(send_back_for_corrections, edit_expense_report)', 'precedence(submit_expense_report, review_expense_report)', 'Init(submit_expense_report)', 'succession(edit_expense_report, review_expense_report)', 'succession(accept_expenses, link_to_payment_system)', 'succession(link_to_payment_system, wait_for_payment_confirmation)', 'succession(wait_for_payment_confirmation, end_process)', 'choice(approve_expense_report, reject_expense_report)', 'choice(accept_expenses, send_back_for_corrections)']",0,11,"['link_to_payment_system', 'reject_expense_report', 'review_expense_report', 'approve_expense_report', 'check_receipts', 'accept_expenses', 'submit_expense_report', 'end_process', 'send_back_for_corrections', 'edit_expense_report', 'wait_for_payment_confirmation']",11
"A small company manufactures customized bicycles. Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created. A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike. In the former case, the process instance is finished. In the latter case, the storehouse and the engineering department are informed. The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part.
